### Version 1.0
This is our initial release. We hope you enjoy it! It includes the usual basics of a clicker, a shop, a clicking function, and of course the pokeballs! Use the pokeballs you collect from clicking to buy various amounts of pokemon to help gather you pokeballs! The games pretty short at this point, but soon it'll be bigger, better, and more balanced for an enjoyable game experience!
